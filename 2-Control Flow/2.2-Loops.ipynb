We will explore the different types of loops used in Python programming, including for loops, while loops, and loop control statements such as break, continue, and pass. We will also discuss nested loops and provide practical examples to illustrate these concepts."

    "#### **For Loops and the Range Function**\n",
    "A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of numbers. The range function helps generate a sequence of numbers. For example, using range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4. The last number is not included. You can also specify a start and stop value, such as range(1, 6), which generates numbers from 1 to 5. The range function can take a third parameter, the step size, which determines the increment between numbers."

    "Loops are powerful constructs in Python that allow you to execute blocks of code multiple times. By understanding and using for and while loops, along with loop control statements like break, continue, and pass, you can handle a wide range of programming tasks efficiently. More examples and applications will be explored as you continue learning.\n",
